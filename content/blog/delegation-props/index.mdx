# Delegation props - simple pattern but often forgotten

In today`s post I would like to share with you a simple pattern called "delegation pattern" (first time I saw that name in the course [The Joy of React](https://www.joyofreact.com) created by [Josh W. Comeau](https://bsky.app/profile/joshwcomeau.com). Idea behind this pattern is just to enable pass all valid props that specific HTML element can accept:

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { type ComponentProps } from 'react'

export const Button = (props: ComponentProps<'button'>) => {
	return <button {...props} />
}
```

Of course I undestand that this example is trivial so let`s take a look on the real world example from my website:

```tsx showLineNumbers {12,21}#a {2,13}#b
import { type VariantProps } from 'class-variance-authority'
import { type ComponentProps } from 'react'
import { cn } from '#app/utils/misc.tsx'
import { buttonVariants } from './button-variants.tsx'

export type ButtonVariant = VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants>

const Button = ({
	className,
	variant,
	size,
	...props
}: ComponentProps<'button'> &
	ButtonVariant & {
		asChild?: boolean
	}) => {
	return (
		<button
			data-slot="button"
			className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant, size, className }))}
			{...props}
		/>
	)
}

export { Button, buttonVariants }
```

The most important part of this code is lines 12 and 21, when first we grab all other props that we are not using directly in the component and we delegate them directly to the HTML `button` element. Thanks to that our consumers of the `Button` component can pass any valid prop that HTML `button` element can accept and with usage of `ComponentProps` we are providing a type safety for those props to avoid situation with passing invalid props.

For the end I want to highlight that this pattern can be used at any time because it does not provide any breaking changes to the component interface but we improve the DX (Developer Experience).
