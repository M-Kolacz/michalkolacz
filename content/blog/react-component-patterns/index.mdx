# The holy grail of React component patterns

At the beginning of my journey as a Software Developer, I was always looking for the best patterns for everything. I quess my obsession with the best patterns started due to low level of confidence of my skills. Now, after years of experience I am aware of that there is no holy grail in terms of patterns, but I have some good ways of writing a code that I would like to share with you.

## Delegation props

```tsx
<Button {...props} />
```

## Respect native conventions

```tsx
<Button text="Hello there" />
```

```tsx
<Button>Hello there</Button>
```

## Compound components

```tsx
<Input>
	<Input.Label>Username</Input.Label>
	<Input.Field />
	<Input.Error>Invalid username</Input.Error>
</Input>
```

## Object index access

```tsx
const variants = {
	primary: 'Hi!',
	secondary: 'Hello!',
}

<Button variant={variant}>{variants[variant]}</Button>
```

Different props depends on the variant.

## React contexts

```tsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light')

const useThemeContext = () => {
	const context = useContext(ThemeContext)

	if (!context) {
		throw new Error('useThemeContext must be used within a ThemeProvider')
	}
	return context
}
```
