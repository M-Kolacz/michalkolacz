# Hello world

If you are reading this blog post it means that I have finally developed something to the world and you can see the results of my work. Many times I tried to start a new project but in the best scenario it ended on the first prototype that was never deployed to production 😅 To not make another mistake I decided to quickly deploy this website even if the User Interface is not great. If this website is still minimalistic with cobalt blue theme it might indicate two things:

- I am still working on the UI of this website.
- I decided to drop this project.

# What I want to achieve with this website?

Mostly I am focusing on the following goals:

- **Use this website to build something fun** - on my X account or on the web I am finding a lot of interesting things that I would like to try. And the best way to try a new things is to build something. This website will be a practice field for these ideas.

- **Share my knowledge** - let`s be honest, I am not sharing my knowledge to help others but to help myself. First I am not native english speaker so creating a content in english is a good way to improve my language skills. Second, teaching others helps me with solidify my own understanding of the subject. And third, it might be fun to maintain this blog.

- **Document my past and future plans** - I would like to create a one subpage on this website that will present my whole carrer path. I already have a plan to use a animations with a timeline to show my path from the beginning to the present. And then if someone will ask me about my carrer path I can redirect that person to this section of the website.

# What will be the next steps?

For sure I need to improve some thing on this website like the UI, color theme and logic related to rendering the blog p osts. Maybe some of these things will be enough interesting to create a new blog post but if not I have a ideas to write about:

- Implement **Client Hints** on this website by using implementation created by [Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/client-hints) and create a blog post where I will explain each of the steps that are required to implement this feature.

- I love a cats so I would like to create a rating component for my blog post and instead of the stars I will use a cat pawns. Each digital pad will represent a star in normal rating component. After submitting your rating the cat sound will be played depending on your score (if you will give me only one cat pawn you will definitly hear that [cat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqH9RoUNG24&t=79s)).

I promise that I will not use AI to generate content for blog posts ✋ I will only use AI to improve my writing skills, but each of the blog posts will be written by me.
